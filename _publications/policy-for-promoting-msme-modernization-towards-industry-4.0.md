# Abstract

The first three industrial revolutions developed as a result of mechanization, electricity invention and applications of information technology (IT). The 3rd industrial revolution started with the first programmable control system automating production in 1969. Since then, a continuous technological breakthrough in engineer- ing, computer and IT led to the 4th industrial revolution which was termed “Industry 4.0” in 2011. This paper attempts to provide an overview of the government policy and programmes in Hong Kong that may play a direct and indirect role for the adaptation of Industry 4.0 by the MSMEs.
