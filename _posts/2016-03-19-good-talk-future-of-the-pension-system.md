Economics 3.0 and the HKIAPS jointly organised the “GoodTalk” show in March 2016, a free public talk series where speakers from a variety of backgrounds are invited to discuss salient economic issues. The theme of the talk was _“Future of the Pension System”_ where the speaker panel was composed of 2 government officials, 2 political party members and 4 academics. The talk was well-received with an audience size of close to 200.
